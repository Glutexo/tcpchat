# TCP chat from a guide #

## About ##

There is a [guide][1] on [SitePoint] telling how to build a simple TCP chat in Ruby using Threads. I used this guide to create the app described.

I made some minor changes, because I didnâ€™t like the code style much. I also added support for correctly handling closed connections. There are some comments to describe how the Threads and loops behave.
